Getting started web Api in asp .net core 3.1

In this project I want to test and implement most of useful NuGet packages about asp .net core web api 
but right now I just implementing :

* simple CRUD api with entity framework core.
* using XUnit test (Integration testing) 

## What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET is a popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform.
ASP.NET Core is the open-source version of ASP.NET, that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. ASP.NET Core was first released in 2016 and is a re-design of earlier Windows-only versions of ASP.NET.
